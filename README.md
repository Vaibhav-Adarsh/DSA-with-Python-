# DSA-with-Python-

ðŸ“˜ A personal repository documenting my journey of learning Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).
This repo includes notes, explanations, and implementations of key DSA concepts in Python (and other languages as I progress). The goal is to build a strong foundation in problem-solving, coding patterns, and algorithmic thinking.

ðŸ”¹ Covers: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and more.
ðŸ”¹ Includes: Practice problems, solutions, and well-commented code.
ðŸ”¹ Purpose: Strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for competitive programming & technical interviews.
